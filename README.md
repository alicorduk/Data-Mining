![Company Logo](https://github.com/alicorduk/Data-Mining/blob/main/Final%20Synthesis%20Assignment/amazon-logo.jpg)


📖 Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of Amazon reviews to build predictive models for sentiment classification. Using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques, the aim is to evaluate and compare model performance for identifying positive and negative sentiments in review texts.

## 🚀 Key Features
Data preprocessing and analysis using Python.
Sentiment classification using various Machine Learning Models:
Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Advanced Deep Learning approach:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with embedding layers.
Model evaluation using metrics like ROC AUC, Precision-Recall AUC, and F1-Score.
## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
Pandas, Numpy (Data Processing)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)
